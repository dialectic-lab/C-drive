- [f]  Woke up at 3 am today - bound to happen when one goes to bed "early", full of hope about rising at 5, the magic number. 
- [ ] Installed a bunch of plugins, but wrong vault directory. Gotta do it all over again.

Ok wait, Obsidian plugins don't automatically run via quartz. Seems like a big problem.
