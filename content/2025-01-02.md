Hello from 2025! 

Deciding to do more of my thinking, planning, documenting, (and general internet-existing) to markdown-fuelled ecosystem. It's not easy, but I'd imagine anyone would go to great lengths to avoid being trapped in the Musk-Pichai-Zuck world.

Just to develop the habit of making my assimilation journey useful to other people, I am going to collect resources that help me on this path, ideally with helpful notes on the whys and hows. For now, what I know is this much:
- Private notes, journals, thoughts, messy work will live on Obsidian, backed up to Proton drive. [Why Proton?](https://proton.me/about)
- The public version will be a Quartz-GitHub Pages site. I suppose it has to be a different vault. Get comfortable learning in public.
	- Related site I like to look at - [Nicole's Notes](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Fork+My+Brain)
- Work I do for [Dialectic](https://dialectic.in/) - essays, data visualisations, newsletter-writing, charts and graphs - they go to blog.dialectic.in, hosted via GitHub pages. So far, I've managed to upload a Quarto project to pages, it works well. R reproducibility, ugh. It is turning out to be a big problem and an obsessive time-sink. There's an annoying error in installing dependencies to GitHub, and it seems to be a problem with a package that keeps coming back every few years, going by stackoverflow posts. I must now choose between:
	- Static visualisations on a Quarto-GitHub set up (makes me sad, but a good way to wait till issues are fixed)
	- Learn to do the same with QuartoPub and GitHub instead of building GH actions from scratch
	- Might be the better workaround - [Save](https://plotly-r.com/saving) individual plotly widgets as htmls and embed them. Also better in the long-term for working on multiple separate projects locally and only uploading finished charts. 
	- I'm not quite ready to consider Quarto alternatives entirely. It's so close to becoming my ideal publishing set up. 
- I blog at chandni.substack.com to stay in touch with friends. Trivialities and depths of life go there. Might be a good idea to duplicate here. You know, in case Substack shuts down, as some[ interesting people](https://tedium.co/thank-you/) seem to be expecting.


Update on the scheduler: From setting up evening morning routines, I've now moved on to creating day-long routines that go on for 16 hours, starting with "brushing teeth" to "going to bed" with some large chunks of space for open ended work. This runs on my iPad, where I trigger it every morning and then set aside. Tasks are spoken out loud when they begin and end. I do have to open the app to record a transition from one task to the next - wish I didn't have to do that. Unfortunately I don't have the time to create one for myself just yet, but someday, I'll have enough reason to make it a weekend project. 

If I do create a custom scheduler/timer/tracker/routine-manager, here's some notes on what it must essentially do:
- Create a sequence of activities with [name] and [duration]
- When triggered, it calls out the activity and time allocated for it 
- When one activity ends, it's announced as complete and the next one is announced.
- Lock screen controls for pausing or changing anything about the sequence
- Ability to pick the next activity, overriding the preset sequence
- Ability to pause an activity and come back to it later
- Log of activities actually completed with timestamps, which will obviously be different from the sequence
- Visualisation of time-logs over weeks and months

I currently use [Routinery](https://routinery.app/), and it does about 75% of the things I need - and all the most important ones that helps regulate my day significantly. I may also have to move it from my iPad to phone to be more effective?

On to setting up my tasks system:
- [ ] First task (ok this is very cool) 🔼 ➕ 2025-01-02 

Installed the community plugin [Tasks](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction) and the [Things](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Statuses) theme.
- [ ] Edit Routinery sequence  

Also super cool that I can pick up a bunch of tasks and set up a [Pomodoro](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=pomodoro-timer) timer for them. No apologies for sounding like a child in disneyland (re)discovering the basics of Obisidian

Next, setting up some writing and creative routines
- [ ] Substack updates 🔁 every day when done 🛫 2025-01-02 #Writing
- [ ] Song translation 🔁 every weekday 🛫 2025-01-02 #Writing
- [ ] Illustrate a page 🔁 every weekday  🛫 2025-01-02 #Art
- [ ] Dialectic post🔁 every week on Wednesday ⏫ 📅  #Writing 
- [ ] Draw something for no reason #Art 🆔 drp18l 🔁 every weekday
- [ ] Maybe add to art shop⛔ drp18l

This is a very useful [guide](https://youtu.be/quXNtjTe5WE?si=8rC1E-ab69xduzWU) to getting started with Obsidian tasks. Thanks, Danny.

I also need to list a bunch of one-time tasks, typically time-sensitive, but not always. 
- [x] Publish vault to blog.chandni.xyz ⏫ ✅ 2025-01-02
- [ ] Complete setup for blog.dialectic.in without ggplot ⏫

Bye? It's kind of awkward to not sign-off or conclude a post in some form, but this is not a blog or newsletter. Just work. Primary audience: me.
